- Room Security Implementation Summary
-
- This file documents the security measures implemented to protect password-protected rooms.
-
- PROBLEM:
- Previously, anyone with a room link could access protected room content even if the room
- had a password. The password was only checked during the initial join process.
-
- SOLUTION:
- Implemented multi-layer password protection:
-
- 1.  Server-side Cookie Validation:
- - Room access requires a valid `room_{CODE}` cookie
- - Cookie is only set after successful PIN verification
- - Cookie has TTL matching room expiration time
-
- 2.  Client-side Protection Component:
- - RoomPasswordProtection wrapper checks access before rendering content
- - Shows password dialog for protected rooms without valid access
- - Prevents content display until authentication is successful
-
- 3.  API Access Control:
- - New `/api/rooms/[code]/check-access` endpoint validates access
- - Returns 401 for unauthorized access attempts
- - Preserves existing join flow for setting cookies
-
- SECURITY FEATURES:
- - ✅ Password required for protected rooms, even with direct links
- - ✅ Session-based access control with secure HTTP-only cookies
- - ✅ Automatic cookie expiration matching room TTL
- - ✅ Client-side validation with server-side enforcement
- - ✅ User-friendly password entry dialog
- - ✅ Toast notifications for feedback
- - ✅ Input validation and error handling
- - ✅ Show/hide password toggle for better UX
- - ✅ Loading states and proper error messages
-
- USAGE FLOW:
- 1.  User accesses room URL directly
- 2.  RoomPasswordProtection checks for valid access cookie
- 3.  If no access and room has PIN: Show password dialog
- 4.  User enters PIN → Validates via join API → Sets cookie
- 5.  On success: Access granted, content displayed
- 6.  On failure: Error shown, PIN cleared, try again
-
- FILES MODIFIED:
- - /components/room-password-protection.tsx (NEW)
- - /api/rooms/[code]/check-access/route.ts (NEW)
- - /app/room/[code]/page.tsx (Enhanced)
-
- BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
- - Existing rooms without passwords work unchanged
- - Existing join flow continues to work
- - No breaking changes to existing functionality
-
- TESTING SCENARIOS:
- 1.  Create room with password → Access directly via URL → Should prompt for PIN
- 2.  Enter correct PIN → Should grant access and show content
- 3.  Enter wrong PIN → Should show error and allow retry
- 4.  Access room without password → Should work normally
- 5.  Access with valid cookie → Should bypass PIN entry
